          Hello!
          <br /> <br /> This page was made to test out and play with the React
          framework.
          <br />
          There are 2 main functionalities:
          <br /> Crypto pricechecker that give you the latest value of the
          chosen Cryptocurrency.
          <br /> And the portfolio for you Crypto currency, where you can
          collect and value your holdings.
          <br /> The api calls sent to the coingecko.com site are very limited
          and doesnt allow for many requests at a time. <br />
          Enjoy!
        </p>
